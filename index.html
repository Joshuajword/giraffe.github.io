    <h1>THE PHENOMENON KNOWN AS GIRAFFE</h1>
    <p1>Webster's defines the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) as a large fleet African ruminant mammal that is the tallest of living quadrapeds and has a very long nexk and a shirt coat with dark blotches separated by pale lines. I like to think that those of us who know and have studied giraffes know they are much more than a simple dictionary entry. They are the most unique of all of the animals, and one of the closest things to a dinosuar we have left...</p>

    <p2>Giraffes can be as tall as 18 feet, or more. The tallest known giraffe alive today is named forest. Adult bull giraffes have the longest necks at around 8 feet, which is a pretty long neck, all things considered.</p2>
